  <h1>Interneting is easy!</h1>
<p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML

  <h2>Headings</h2>
  <P>Headings define the outine of your site. There are six levels of headings.</h2>

<!-- this is an unordered list "ul" element -->
    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <p>This is how you make an unordered list</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
<li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
<li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
</ul>

<!-- this is an ordered list "ol" element -->
    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everythimg</li>
        <li>But, the list item are the same</li>
        <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
        <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list</li>
        </ol>

        <!-- this is an <em> emphasis element -->
        <h2>Inline elements</h2>
        <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase</p>

        <!-- this a bold "strong" element -->
        <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>

        <!-- this is but "strong" and "em" element -->
        <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>

<!-- line breaks -->
<h2>Empty elements</h2>

    <!-- thematic break -->
<!-- use horizontal rule "<hr/>" element to tell our browser that we want a thematic break -->
